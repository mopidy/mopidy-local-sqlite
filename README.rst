Mopidy-Local-SQLite
========================================================================

Mopidy-Local-SQLite is a Mopidy_ local library extension that uses an
SQLite_ database for keeping track of your local media.  This
extension lets you browse your music collection by album, artist,
composer and performer, and provides full-text search capabilities
based on SQLite's FTS_ modules.  It also notices updates via ``mopidy
local scan`` while Mopidy is running, so you can scan your media
library periodically from a cron job, for example.


Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mopidy-Local-SQLite can be installed using pip_ by running::

    pip install Mopidy-Local-SQLite


Configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before starting Mopidy, you must change your configuration to switch
to using Mopidy-Local-SQLite as your preferred local library.  It is
also recommended to change the default ``scan_flush_threshold``, to
improve database access during a local scan::

    [local]
    library = sqlite
    scan_flush_threshold = 100

Once this has been set you need to re-scan your library to populate
the database::

    mopidy local scan

This extension also provides some configuration settings of its own,
but be aware that these are still subject to change::

  [local-sqlite]
  enabled = true

  # top-level directories for browsing, as <name> <uri>
  directories =
      Albums                  local:directory?type=album

Known Bugs and Limitations
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The database schema does not support multiple artists, composers or
performers for a single track or album.  Look out for "Ignoring
multiple artists" warnings during a local scan to see if you are
affected by this.
